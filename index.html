<p>The Theta Theta Chapter of Alpha Phi was officially established in 1991, and became the third sorority to
join Saint Joseph's University campus.</p>


<p>Currently, we have 129 beautiful active sisters. As a chapter, we strive to uphold the values of sisterhood,
leadership, service, and scholarship. The Theta Theta Chapter is known for hosting our annual philanthropy
events, which many people look forward to every semester. These events include Laugh Your Heart Out, Phi Ball
and our annual Red Dress Gala. All proceeds of these fundraisers benefit the Alpha Phi Foundation,
which supports cardiac care for women.</p>


<p>Not only do we have our wonderful philanthropy events each semester, but we also look forward to date party,
formal, mother's initation, and all of our amazing sisterhood events that bring all 129 of us so close.
Every sister in our chapter possesses the values of an Alpha Phi and are uniqely special. Our chapter
does not only develop relationships that last 4 years, but for a lifetime.</p>
