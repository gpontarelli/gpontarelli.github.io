<p>Alpha Phi was founded at Syracuse University by ten of the first nineteen women admitted to the newly
  opened university. Our founders were women with brave hearts that were filled with a noble purpose and
  with eyes that saw clearly into the future.</p>

  <p>These were the Original Ten, the founders of Alpha Phi.
  Pursuing their studies in a thoroughly male-dominated environment, these women had a pressing need for
  friends who could sympathize with each other's problems and support each other's aspirations.
  On September 18, 1872, these ten women initiated themselves into Alpha Phi. To learn more about the
  great legacy of Alpha Phi, check out www.alphaphi.org.</p>
