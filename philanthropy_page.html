<p>Alpha Phi was one of the first women’s fraternities to establish a devoted foundation back in 1956.
When you become an Alpha Phi, you take part in the celebration of women’s cardiac care through the Alpha Phi Foundation;
our philanthropy. Heart disease is the #1 killer of women.
Through the Alpha Phi Foundation, some of the values we celebrate are: improving women’s heart health,
supporting sisters in need and educating about the value of philanthropy.</p>



<p>To help raise money for this incredible foundation, we have many events throughout the year.
Every fall, we have our annual Red Dress Gala. The Red Dress Gala is our biggest event of the entire year.
Alpha Phi is the only fraternity nationwide who have a gala this big. In addition to the Gala, in this past we
have had other campus-wide events such as "Cardiac Arrest," "Jail n Bail," "Alpha-Phi-Esta," "A-PHI-ASCO,"
"Phi Ball" and "Laugh Your Heart Out." We also participate in the American Heart Association's "Cardiac Week"
every February, we attended the 2014 American Heart Association Heart Ball, and also participated in the
American Heart Association Heart Walk at Citizens Bank Park every November.</p>



<p>The amazing Alpha Phi Foundation, not only means a great deal to the sisters of Alpha Phi,
but to many of our families, and other families who have been affected by Heart disease.
Over the years, our chapter has raised thousands of dollars for this amazing foundation though our hard
work and dedication. In the past, the Alpha Phi Foundation donated $50,000 yearly to various hospitals
though the Alpha Phi Heart-to-Heart Grant. However, as of 2014, we are proud to announce the Alpha Phi
Foundation now donates $100,000 dollars yearly.Because of this grant, SO many lives have been saved.</p>
