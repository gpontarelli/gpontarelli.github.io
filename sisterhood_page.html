<p>The Theta Theta chapter of Alpha Phi holds our sisterhood very close to our hearts. Sisterhood is value that
connects each and every one of us and compiles all our different personalities and beliefs. We strive to
build bonds that last past the four years of college into the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>We plan our sisterhood events off ideas and interests of our members. Some of our events include:
holiday celebrations, professional sporting events, and recreational activities such as Skyzone and
Linvilla Orchards. Every semester, we also get all dolled up for date party, and PHormal. Each of
these events provides opportunities for all of our sisters to get to know each other on many different
levels. Something special to Alpha Phi International is mother's initiation. This is a weekend wheres
seniors in Alpha Phi can invite their mother's to become their sisters. Through these events each class
of women spends time with all the grades integrating all generations of our sorority. Also, through our
alumnae newsletters, and Red Dress Gala, we are building a relationship with the alumnae
of our Theta Theta chapter.</p>


<p>With each of these opportunities, our sisters are creating memories and learning about life while being
supported by dozens of sisters around them.</p>
