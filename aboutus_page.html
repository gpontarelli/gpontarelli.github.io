<p>Alpha Phi is a sisterhood of outstanding women supporting one another in lifelong achievement.</p>

<p>Alpha Phi was founded at Syracuse University by ten of the first nineteen women admitted to the newly
opened university. Our founders were women with brave hearts that were filled with a noble purpose and
with eyes that saw clearly into the future.</p>

<p>These were the Original Ten, the founders of Alpha Phi.
Pursuing their studies in a thoroughly male-dominated environment, these women had a pressing need for
friends who could sympathize with each other's problems and support each other's aspirations.
On September 18, 1872, these ten women initiated themselves into Alpha Phi.</p>

<p>The sisterhood of Alpha Phi stretches from coast to coast through 164 collegiate campuses and more
than 200,000 members.Sisters share a commitment to excellence and a strong desire to help one another
and their communities. Alpha Phis are leaders, scholars, contributors and lifetime members of a sisterhood
that values these traits. Alpha Phi assists college women in making informed choices to reach their highest
potential. Alpha Phi enhances and promotes each member's development and learning by focusing on
sisterhood, service, scholarship, leadership, loyalty and character development.</p>
