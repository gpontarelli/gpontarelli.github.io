<p>Alpha Phi is so excited to receive new members in the Spring 2016! This is the start of lifelong college
friendships and a great way to get involved in the SJU community. We hope you are as excited to meet us
as we are to meet you!</p>


<p>Formal Sorority Recruitment is an opportunity for all second semester freshmen,
upperclassmen and transfer students to explore membership in the Panhellenic Council sororities.
Over the course of 5 days, potential new members will visit with each chapter. At the end of each day,
the potential new members make selections to narrow their options while the chapters do the same.
This process is known as mutual selection and uses a computer system to generate matches and schedules.
Each morning, potential new members receive their schedule for the day from the Rho Chis
(Recruitment Counselors). The Rho Chis serve as mentors throughout the process, remaining disassociated
from their chapters throughout fall semester and formal recruitment to provide unbiased advice and support.</p>
